# The Assisted Installer User Interface

The Assisted Installer makes IPI (Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure) OpenShift cluster
deployments on bare metal easy.

Hosts building the cluster are discovered by booting an ISO image downloaded from the Assisted
Installer.

By entering a few necessary configuration details (like cluster name, base domain, SSH public keys
or network specifics), the Assisted Installer handles all the deployment and configuration
automatically, resulting in a ready-to-use cluster.

This project is a user interface backed by Assisted Installer API.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), on Fedora/Centos:
  ```
  dnf install -y nodejs yarn
  ```
- Clone repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/openshift-assisted/assisted-ui.git
  cd assisted-ui
  ```

### Build and run in DEV-mode

- Install javascript dependencies:
  ```
  yarn install
  ```
- Start the webpack dev server to run the application in dev-mode with:

  - Environment variables:

  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL: required, URL of the BM Inventory
  REACT_APP_CLUSTER_PERMISSIONS=JSON to pass in permission restrictions
    The JSON currently admits the `canEdit` parameter.
    eg. REACT_APP_CLUSTER_PERMISSIONS={"canEdit": false}

  BROWSER: optional, locally installed browser used to open the web application in
  ```

  - Command:

  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=[YOUR_ASSISTED-SERVICE_URL] yarn start
  ```

  - Example:

  ```
  REACT_APP_API_URL=`minikube service assisted-service --url` BROWSER=chromium-browser yarn start
  ```

- Open the UI at `http://localhost:3000`

## Running integration tests

TBD

## Running the production server

TBD

## Production build

You can compile the production executable by running:

```
$ yarn build
```

Optionally, set the configuration environment variables which you want to use
Example:

```
$ REACT_APP_API_URL='http://192.168.2.42:6008' yarn build
```

## Container image build

You can build the container image by running:

```
$ podman build -t quay.io/edge-infrastructure/assisted-installer-ui:latest . --build-arg REACT_APP_GIT_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --build-arg REACT_APP_VERSION=latest
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

Installs dependencies to node_modules directory

### `yarn format`

This application uses Prettier to check and format code. You can run the above command to clean your
code, or you can [integrate it with your editor](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html), and set
up a Prettier extension and formatting changes will automatically be applied when you save.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br> Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to
view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br> You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br> See the section about
[running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br> It correctly bundles React in production
mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br> Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `yarn run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel,
ESLint, etc) right into your project, so you have full control over them. All the commands except
`eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, so you can tweak them. At this
point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle
deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this
tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
